# Cloud Detection Automation
Initial placeholder.

# ☁️ Cloud Detection Automation (AWS)

### Overview
Automating detection and response in AWS using native services and lightweight scripting.

### Objectives
- Enable **GuardDuty**, **Security Hub**, and **AWS Config Rules**.  
- Use **AWS Lambda** to automatically notify Slack/email on high-severity findings.  
- Store alerts centrally in Splunk for visibility.

### Tools & Services
AWS (GuardDuty, Config, Lambda, S3, IAM, CloudTrail) · Python (boto3) · Splunk HEC

### Architecture Diagram
*(Insert diagram of GuardDuty → Lambda → Slack workflow)*

### Sample Automation Flow
1. GuardDuty detects suspicious activity.  
2. Lambda fetches event details using boto3.  
3. Sends formatted JSON payload to Slack webhook.  
4. Event stored in Splunk index for correlation.

### Metrics & Outcomes
- Reduced mean detection-to-alert time by ~70%.  
- Enabled centralized visibility of AWS findings.  

### Next Steps
- Add Terraform deployment templates.  
- Integrate Azure equivalent detections.
