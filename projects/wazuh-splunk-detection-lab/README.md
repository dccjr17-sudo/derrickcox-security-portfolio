Initial placeholder.

# ðŸ§  Wazuh + Splunk Detection Lab

### Overview
A home-lab SOC environment integrating **Wazuh (HIDS)** with **Splunk (SIEM)** for centralized log management, correlation, and detection engineering practice.

### Objectives
- Build and secure a hybrid SIEM pipeline (Wazuh â†’ Splunk).
- Create detections mapped to **MITRE ATT&CK** techniques.
- Automate enrichment and alert notification workflows.

### Tools & Technologies
Wazuh Â· Splunk Â· Python Â· PowerShell Â· MITRE ATT&CK Â· Sysmon Â· Windows/Linux endpoints

### Detection Examples
| Technique | Rule Summary | MITRE ID |
|------------|--------------|----------|
| Privilege Escalation | Detects `whoami /groups` executed by non-admin users | T1068 |
| Persistence | Detects creation of suspicious autorun keys | T1547 |

### Key Takeaways
- Improved understanding of event correlation and SIEM tuning.  
- Reduced false positives through custom rule logic.  

### Next Steps
- Add dashboard screenshots  
- Write blog summary on LinkedIn/Medium
